Consequently, significant opportunities remain for the development of extensible modeling systems that operate robustly across regions. Towards the development of such a robust hydrological modeling system, this paper introduces the Solver for Hydrological Unstructured Domain (SHUD), an integrated multi-process, multi-scale, multi-timestep hydrological model, in which hydrological processes are fully coupled using the semi-discrete Finite Volume Method. The SHUD integrates overland flow, snow accumulation/melting, evapotranspiration, subsurface and groundwater flow, and river routing, while realistically capturing the physical processes in a watershed.\nThe SHUD incorporates one-dimension unsaturated flow, two-dimension groundwater flow, and river channels connected with hillslopes via overland flow and baseflow.\nThis paper introduces the design of SHUD, from the conceptual and mathematical description of hydrological processes in a watershed to computational structures. To demonstrate and validate the model performance, we employ three hydrological experiments: the V-Catchment experiment, Vauclin's experiment, and a study of the Cache Creek Watershed in northern California, USA.\nPossible applications of then SHUD model include hydrological studies from the hillslope scale to regional scale, water resource and stormwater management, and coupling research with related fields such as limnology, agriculture, geochemistry, geomorphology, water quality, and ecology, climatic and landuse change. In general, SHUD is a valuable scientific tool for any modeling task involving simulating and understanding hydrological response.\n","date":1574668800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1574668800,"objectID":"dd327aec1c211f77164ab6dc21c484bf","permalink":"https://www.shulele.net/zh/publication/shu2019_shud/","publishdate":"2019-11-25T00:00:00-08:00","relpermalink":"/zh/publication/shu2019_shud/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper introduces the design of SHUD, from the conceptual and mathematical description of hydrological processes in a watershed to computational structures.

In the Solver of Hydrologic Unstructured Domain (SHUD) model, the system of ODEs describing the hydrological processes is fully coupled and solved simultaneously at each time step ($ \\Delta t=t_{n}-t_{n-1}$) using CVODE, a stiff solver based on Newton-Krylov iteration.\nThe latest version of SUNDIALS is v5.0.0, released on November 2019. Let's install it on a Mac OS or Linux system.\nI test the installation on Mac 10.13 and Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS (GNU/Linux 4.15.0-66-generic x86_64)\n Download SUNDIALS, via https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/sundials/sundials-software. Or get latest SUNDIALS on GitHub:  git clone https://github.com/LLNL/sundials.git Now, you must have the source code of SUNDIALS in your folder. Please enter the folder. Let's assume you are in the same level of sundials.\nCreate a install folder.  The installation folder names installSundials\nmkdir installSundials cd installSundials rm -rf builddir instdir srcdir mkdir builddir mkdir instdir mkdir srcdir cd builddir/ Configure the installation with CCMAKE.  There are two ways to configure the installation. One is GUI, and the other is command line.\n Option 1, type command blow:  ccmake ../../sundials/ You will see a screen like this: Use your cursor, move to line CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX, which is the path SUNDIALS will be installed. Press Enter to start edit the line. I install it on /usr/local/sundials\nAnother path you may change is the path of example code, EXAMPLES_INSTALL_PATH.\nNext, you need to select which solver you want to install, such as, ARKODE, CVODE, CVODES IDA, IDAS, KINSOL. They are on the top of your GUI; press Enter to enable or disable it. Since I need the CVODE only, I turn the BUILD_CVODE option ON and keep the rest of them OFF.\nIf you have OpenMP on your machine and you need the support of OpenMP parallel in your program, you can turn the OPENMP_ENABLE ON.\nAfter edits, press C to configure, and press C again, when g option shows up on the bottom, press g to generate configuration files.\n Option 2, you can use command to realise the edits above, for example:  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local/sundials \\ -DEXAMPLES_INSTALL_PATH=../example \\ -DBUILD_CVODE=ON \\ -DBUILD_CVODES=OFF \\ -DBUILD_ARKODE=OFF \\ -DBUILD_CVODES=OFF \\ -DBUILD_IDA=OFF \\ -DBUILD_IDAS=OFF \\ -DBUILD_KINSOL=OFF \\ -DOPENMP_ENABLE=ON \\ ../../sundials/ The command above configure installation, to install SUNDIALS to /usr/local/sundials, the examples to ../example, install CVODE only, with OpenMP support.\nIf you don't need OpenMP or your OpenMP may result in errors, use the command below:\ncmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local/sundials \\ -DEXAMPLES_INSTALL_PATH=../example \\ -DBUILD_CVODE=ON \\ -DBUILD_CVODES=OFF \\ -DBUILD_ARKODE=OFF \\ -DBUILD_CVODES=OFF \\ -DBUILD_IDA=OFF \\ -DBUILD_IDAS=OFF \\ -DBUILD_KINSOL=OFF \\ -DOPENMP_ENABLE=OFF \\ ../../sundials/ make and install  This is simple and easy, run:\nmake make install Sometimes, if the system may require higher previlage. If so, please try to use sudo:\nmake sudo make install If there is no error occur, the SUNDIALS is installed successfully. Congrats.\nTest the SUNDIALS library with the examples.  Enter the example folder, ../example as the Option 2 in step 3. You will see several examples. Use make to compile all of them:\n cd ../example/cvode/serial/ ls make After make, you will see files like this:\n Test the program:\n./cvAdvDiff_bnd ./cvKrylovDemo_ls   Now, you can use SUNDIALS/CVODE in your own numeric solver.\nBe patient, you will meet more challenges.\n","date":1574229938,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1574229938,"objectID":"3a75dfb2481ee41786d8cb0dff7b0c33","permalink":"https://www.shulele.net/zh/post/20191119_sundials/","publishdate":"2019-11-19T22:05:38-08:00","relpermalink":"/zh/post/20191119_sundials/","section":"post","summary":"SUNDIALS: SUite of Nonlinear and DIfferential/ALgebraic Equation Solvers SUNDIALS (https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/sundials) is a very powerful mathematical library that is helpful in solving engineering and scientific problems efficiently.

However, models that do not consider both fast and slow processes may not accurately reflect the feedbacks that define complex systems. We evaluated current coupled human–freshwater system modeling approaches in the literature with a focus on categorizing feedback loops as including economic and/or socio-cultural processes and identifying the simulation of fast and slow processes in human and biophysical systems. Fast human and fast biophysical processes are well represented in the literature, but very few studies incorporate slow human and slow biophysical system processes. Challenges in simulating coupled human–freshwater systems can be overcome by quantifying various monetary and non-monetary ecosystem values and by using data aggregation techniques.

The secondary objective of this proposal is to leverage this assessment capability to improve our ability to predict these outcomes, by identifying the process-level drivers of outcome biases and evaluating the most appropriate and efficient ways to couple climate models, hydrologic models, and models of human impacts. Tasks in hydrologic modeling  Develop a hydrologic modeling system for both the Sacramento watershed and several subcatchments. Calculate key hydrological metrics, including stream flow, groundwater table, soil moisture, and snow pack. Evaluate the quality of the hydrologic model and identify potential issues related to its performance. Develop a statistical downscaling technique using both traditional statistical and machine learning methods that digests input to the hydrologic model and mimics the output of the model. Determine which input variables are most relevant for producing an accurate statistical model.     Spatial Data Annual Precipitation          Sacramento Watershed The Sacramento River flows from Southern Oregon and to San Francisco Bay. Total drainage area is ~72000 km2. Elevation ranges from 0 to 4200m. The climate in SW is semi-arid hot Mediterranean. The spatial climatic characteristics are not only affected by latitude, terrain and snow coverage, but also by wind and ocean currents. Dramatic seasonal and annual climatic variations exist as well as large spatial heterogeneity. The mountains on the eastern and northern edges of the domain accumulate rain and snow which funnels into the groundwater of the whole watershed. Annual precipitation ranges from 400 mm/year to 1500 mm/year, however extreme annual precipitation was more than 4000 mm/year in Northern mountainous area in 1983, and mean precipitation was only 270 mm/year from the 2013 extreme drought year.\n   Monthly variation of precipitation in Sacramento Watershed Annual precipitation variation from 1979 to 2017 based on NLDAS data          Simulation and Results The calibration of the PIHM model used the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) (Hansen 2006,Auger 2005). The automatic CMA-ES calibration is robust and able to converge to global optimization with low computing cost.\nRiver discharge The stream flow in the watershed follows the seasonal variation of precipitation. During drought years, the base flow from groundwater depletion contributes to the streamflow, and the excess infiltration replenishes ground water in wet seasons. For small watersheds in the Central Valley, such as catchment #9 where precipitation is less and the aquifer is thicker, the contribution from groundwater is small.\nGround water variation The ground water near the river channel is shallower than the hill-slope. The spatial distribution pattern of ground water is controlled by topography, soil/geology characteristics and shape of the watershed. Steep slopes store less ground water than moderate slopes, because a steep hydraulic gradient on steep slopes drive the lateral groundwater flow.\n             Ground water spatial distribution Temporal fluctuation from 2000 to 2017.    Ground water seasonal fluctuation follows the climatic variation. However, the seasonal variations in some catchments are relatively larger than others. The inter-annual variation in #5 sub-catchment is larger than seasonal variation. Although the annual precipitation trends in each sub-catchments are comparable, the trend in multiple-year changes of ground water table varies. This requires further analysis on water balance and the memory effect of ground water storage.\n","date":1550974394,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1550974394,"objectID":"d57004782bbac91f799101996134fb02","permalink":"https://www.shulele.net/zh/project/hyperion/","publishdate":"2019-02-23T21:13:14-05:00","relpermalink":"/zh/project/hyperion/","section":"project","summary":"Introduction of HYPERION  The objective of HYPERION is the development of a comprehensive regional hydroclimate data assessment capability focused on feature-specific metrics and stakeholder-relevant outcomes.

Coupled natural and human systems (CNHS) modeling is one tool that can be used to study the complex, reciprocal linkages between human actions and ecosystem processes. Well-developed CNHS models exist at a conceptual level, but the mapping of these system representations in practice is limited in capturing these feedbacks. This article presents a paired conceptual-empirical methodology for functionally capturing feedbacks between human and natural systems in freshwater lake catchments, from human actions to the ecosystem and from the ecosystem back to human actions. We address extant challenges in CNHS modeling, which arise from differences in disciplinary approach, model structure, and spatiotemporal resolution, to connect a suite of models. In doing so, we create an integrated, multi-disciplinary tool that captures diverse processes that operate at multiple scales, including land-management decision-making, hydrologic-solute transport, aquatic nutrient cycling, and civic engagement. In this article, we build on this novel framework to advance cross-disciplinary dialogue to move CNHS lake-catchment modeling in a systematic direction and, ultimately, provide a foundation for smart decision-making and policy.

One is the Penn State Integrated Hydrologic Model (PIHM), a hydrologic model that partitions the water balance in space and time over the urban catchment. The other is the Cellular Automata Land Use Change Model (CALUC), a land use change model, which simulates the evolution of land use classes based on physical measures associated with population change and land use demand factors. We selected two study sites, one modern and one ancient, to highlight the capability of coupling catchment hydrology with land use change models. The goal is to assess the role of hydrologic change in urbanizing watersheds and to evaluate the contemporaneous impacts of climate change. The modern sites are the Conestoga watershed and the Lancaster PA urban center; the historical site is the ancient Maya city of Tikal in Peten region of Guatemala. In each setting, the essential data was developed and the models were used to evaluate how urbanization and land use change gradually altered the entire water balance often in unexpected ways.

Humans derive great benefit from the irreplaceable services provided by lakes, such as drinking water, recreation, and fisheries, while at the same time contributing to the degradation of the very waters upon which they depend. However, degradation in the water quality attributes that people value can serve as a catalyst for behavioral change through collective action, as evidenced by the increasing momentum of citizen-driven lake associations. To identify and quantify these feedbacks between lake water quality and human behavior, we propose to develop a novel, coupled modeling framework that captures how land-use decision making interacts with hydrological and limnological processes to transform nutrient loads into changes in lake water quality, and how altered water quality feeds back to human systems by affecting the amenities that people value. Our model will extend our interdisciplinary focus by examining how lake associations respond to changes in lake water quality and how their activities influence the behavior of citizens and policy makers to protect their freshwater resources. To construct the coupled model, we will augment our data and modeling resources with new information on the organizational capacity and effectiveness of three active and established lake associations. Our coupled modeling framework flexibly links key human and natural systems in three focal lake catchments, allowing us to investigate human-natural feedbacks in those catchments and to build on our understanding of those linkages to generate insight into CNHS at a broad scale.\nTasks in hydrologic modeling   Coupling the watershed hydrologic modeling with lake modeling. *\n  Lake Mendota in 3D\n  Lake Sunapee in 3D\n  keep updating\n","date":1500862394,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1500862394,"objectID":"fb98ae3691ae307cad98358540eaa1dc","permalink":"https://www.shulele.net/zh/project/cnh_lak/","publishdate":"2017-07-23T21:13:14-05:00","relpermalink":"/zh/project/cnh_lak/","section":"project","summary":"This project is the hydrology-lake modeling part of the whole project.

Following an introduction to the overall architecture, the designs for module linkage and data transfer between modules are described in details. Using XML based meta-information, modules in either source codes or binary form can be utilized by the environment. As a demonstration, with the help of HIME, we replaced the evaporation module of TOPMODEL with the evapotranspiration module from the Noah land surface model which explicitly accounts for vegetation transpiration.
