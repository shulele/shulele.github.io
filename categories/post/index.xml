      <description>Global NDVI
 The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is a simple graphical indicator that reflect the greenness and the heath condition of vegetations.
The raw data is from NASA MOD13A.
 The global NDVI variation from 2002 to 2017. 
 The NDVI varies from 2002 to 2017 in US (Continental) 
  How to download the rawdata The code of the monthly NDVI from MODIS dataset is MOD13C2, so type the code below in your terminal and the wget will download all availalble data from server to you local matchine.</description>

      <description>Bayesian probability Inference Educated guessing
Thomas Bayes A nonconformist; two books, about theology and probability.
Bayesian inference Guessing the probability in the style of Bayes
Bayesian probability also known as evidential probability, is the process of adding prior probability to a hypothesis and adjusting that probability as new information becomes available. Unlike traditional frequentist probability which only accounts for the previous frequency of an event to predicate and outcome, the Bayesian model begins with an initial set of subjective assumptions (prior probability) and adjusts them accordingly through trial and experimentation (posterior probability).</description>

      <title>The project to plot planets/objects in space and orbital movement.</title>

      <description>I planed to write an R package and submit on CRAN, that can plot the planets orbiting in Solar System, or satellite/moon orbiting around earth. That package must plot the moving planets, the moon, moon phase and satellite in 2D or 3D canvas. In future, it may calculate the orbit based on orbit mechanics.
My son loves the song “The wheels on the bus go round and round“, and he has an obsession on planets.</description>

      <description>Motivation of the project This is fantastic program to teach the local kids and lead them into the discovering sciences.
 Panoview of the Math&amp;Science classroom.  Week 02: Week 03: Jessica is writing students observation and discussion of plants in two different soils (Sperpentine and sandy loam).   Week 05: Week 05: The growth condition of their beans.  Week 05: One question from students&#39; question box. Question: Why are my plants leaves sticky?</description>
