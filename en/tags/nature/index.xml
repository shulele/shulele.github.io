      <title>Avoid stigmatizing names for 2019 novel coronavirus</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The coronavirus that is currently causing severe respiratory illness worldwide has now been named SARS-CoV-2, and the disease is COVID-19. When the virus first emerged last December, it was generally described in medical journals as the ‘2019 novel coronavirus’. Nature, however, used ‘China coronavirus’ and ‘Wuhan coronavirus’. Such interim terminology based on geographic characteristics is objectionable because it can stimulate prejudice and discrimination against Chinese people, fuelled internationally by fear spread through social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it is difficult and time-consuming to formally name diseases and viruses, it is essential that we methodically select no-harm names for them to make their way into human history. In 2015, the World Health Organization issued guidelines intended to minimize “unnecessary negative impact of disease names on trade, travel, tourism or animal welfare, and avoid causing offence to any cultural, social, national, regional, professional or ethnic groups”. It asks scientists, journalists and health officials to use neutral, generic terms when referring to new human infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Editor’s note&lt;/strong&gt;: Nature has stopped referring to the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) as the Wuhan or China virus, for the reasons cited in the Correspondence. The names that appeared in earlier headlines were used to reflect the situation as it was understood at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>China’s different shades of greening</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Your view that China’s re-vegetation of its deserts could exacerbate water shortages risks oversimplifying an incredibly complex eco-restoration problem (Nature 573, 474–475; 2019).
Far from just planting trees in arid areas, China’s re-vegetation codes vary for different regions and greening programmes. The nationwide Grain-to-Green programme, for example, aims to restore unstable and low-productivity farmlands to forest or natural vegetation. In humid areas, research optimizes greening programmes for plant selection and socio- economic benefits. And China’s re-vegetation projects are confined to a range that local water resources can sustain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Re-vegetation, like any eco-restoration strategy, is not a catch-all solution to carbon sequestration, soil erosion and flooding. But, rather than worrying mainly about water consumption, Chinese and other scientists are investigating the nexus of vegetation, soil, water, ecosystems and human society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nature 577, 29 (2019)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
