@phdthesis{Shu2017,
abstract = {The past one hundred years have seen a tremendous migration to towns and cities worldwide. This population movement exerts serious impacts on surface and ground-water supplies, soil health, and the sustainability of ecosystems. At the same time, climate change has become a decisive influence on water systems as land conversion continues. Historically, urbanization and climate change were two important determinants in the sustainability of water, food and energy supplies, as well as the increasing risk of environmental hazards. At the watershed scale the evolving land use change in urban areas does not only change the flood risk because of increasing impervious areas or by directly reducing the consumption of water by trees and plants, but also fundamentally alters the local water balance and the partitioning of water within the land-atmosphereecological system. Both land use change and climate change may influence the urban watershed in ways that reinforce or compensate sustainable management. In this study we applied two spatially explicit models to the problem. One is the Penn State Integrated Hydrologic Model (PIHM), a hydrologic model that partitions the water balance in space and time over the urban catchment. The other is the Cellular Automata Land Use Change Model (CALUC), a land use change model, which simulates the evolution of land use classes based on physical measures associated with population change and land use demand factors. We selected two study sites, one modern and one ancient, to highlight the capability of coupling catchment hydrology with land use change models. The goal is to assess the role of hydrologic change in urbanizing watersheds and to evaluate the contemporaneous impacts of climate change. The modern sites are the Conestoga watershed and the Lancaster PA urban center; the historical site is the ancient Maya city of Tikal in Peten region of Guatemala. In each setting, the essential data was developed and the models were used to evaluate how urbanization and land use change gradually altered the entire water balance often in unexpected ways. Chapter 1 introduces the overall problem and carries out a comprehensive literature review for each of the following chapters. Chapter 2 discusses the relevant models used in the study, and the role of model parameterization, particularly the important role that macropores have on maintaining a healthy soil and supporting soil moisture and recharge to groundwater. Chapter 2 also describes the Cellular Automata Land Use Change model, which is adopted here to simulate land use conditions. Chapter 3 then evaluates the past, present and future land use conditions in the Conestoga watershed and develops quantitative metrics of evaluation. Chapter 4 extends the Conestoga case study to evaluate hydrologic performance when dynamic land use and future climate change scenarios from IPCC are the drivers. An evaluation of the relative importance of land use and climate to hydrologic change is presented. Chapter 5 implements the models in a retrospective scenario of the water history of the ancient Maya city of Tikal and discusses the problem of urbanization-deforestation-agriculture land conversion, and the likely sensitivity of their water supply to extreme climate events. Chapter 6 summarizes the two case studies and makes inferences on the resilience and elasticity of the two study sites to climate and land use change.},

@article{Cobourn2018,
abstract = {Recent debate over the scope of the U.S. Clean Water Act underscores the need to develop a robust body of scientific work that defines the connectivity between freshwater systems and people. Coupled natural and human systems (CNHS) modeling is one tool that can be used to study the complex, reciprocal linkages between human actions and ecosystem processes. Well-developed CNHS models exist at a conceptual level, but the mapping of these system representations in practice is limited in capturing these feedbacks. This article presents a paired conceptual-empirical methodology for functionally capturing feedbacks between human and natural systems in freshwater lake catchments, from human actions to the ecosystem and from the ecosystem back to human actions. We address extant challenges in CNHS modeling, which arise from differences in disciplinary approach, model structure, and spatiotemporal resolution, to connect a suite of models. In doing so, we create an integrated, multi-disciplinary tool that captures diverse processes that operate at multiple scales, including land-management decision-making, hydrologic-solute transport, aquatic nutrient cycling, and civic engagement. In this article, we build on this novel framework to advance cross-disciplinary dialogue to move CNHS lake-catchment modeling in a systematic direction and, ultimately, provide a foundation for smart decision-making and policy.},

@article{Nan2011,
abstract = {Environmental and water issues are essentially complex interdisciplinary problems. Multiple models from different disciplines are usually integrated to solve those problems. Integrated modeling environment is an effective technical approach to model integration. Although a number of modeling environments worldwide are available, they cannot meet current challenges faced. Their old-fashion designs and original development purposes constrain their possible applications to the domain of hydrologic or land surface modeling. One of the challenges is that we intend to link knowledge database or ontology system to the modeling environment in order to make the modeling support more intelligent and powerful. In this paper, we designed and implemented an integrated modeling environment (HIME) for hydrological and land surface modeling purpose in a much extendable, efficient and easy use manner. With such design, a physical process was implemented as a module, or component. A new model can be generated in an intuitive way by linking module icons together and establishing their relationships. Following an introduction to the overall architecture, the designs for module linkage and data transfer between modules are described in details. Using XML based meta-information, modules in either source codes or binary form can be utilized by the environment. As a demonstration, with the help of HIME, we replaced the evaporation module of TOPMODEL with the evapotranspiration module from the Noah land surface model which explicitly accounts for vegetation transpiration. This example showed the effectiveness and efficiency of the modeling environment on model integration.},
