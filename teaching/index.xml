      <description>I love to train the next generation of hydrologists and environmental scientists. Just as the invention of computer to realize the ideas in sciences, the numeric modeling also provides flexible and assessable perspective on the watershed and the nature-human relationship. It is my belief that every student is capable of tasting the passion that I feel for hydrologic modeling by becoming practitioner in the exploration of hydrological theories, researches and models.</description>

      <description>Objective The objective to this class is to learn the steps involved in developing mathematical models for applied environmental/water resources problems, and using numerical methods to solve these mathematical models.
To become familiar with:
 explicit method, implicit method, Linear/Non-Linear Partial Differential Equations (PDE), and numeric solutions for advection-dispersion equations.  To write or use existing finite element and/or boundary element programs to analyze project scale problems.â€¨Prerequisite for attendee  College calculus and algebra Groundwater hydraulics Basic programming knowledge, such as C/C++, Java, R, python, Matlab, etc.</description>
