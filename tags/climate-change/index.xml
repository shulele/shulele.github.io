      <description>Introduction of HYPERION  The objective of HYPERION is the development of a comprehensive regional hydroclimate data assessment capability focused on feature-specific metrics and stakeholder-relevant outcomes. The secondary objective of this proposal is to leverage this assessment capability to improve our ability to predict these outcomes, by identifying the process-level drivers of outcome biases and evaluating the most appropriate and efficient ways to couple climate models, hydrologic models, and models of human impacts.</description>

      <description>This project is the hydrology-lake modeling part of the whole project. The leading project is CNH-L: Linking land-use decision making, water quality, and lake associations to understand human-natural feedbacks in lake catchments, cooperated with multiple universities and institutes(e.g. Virginia Tech, Pennsylvania State University, University of Wisconsin, Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies, Michigan State University ).
Introduction of project  Freshwater lakes and their catchments present a rich and fascinating opportunity to examine the dynamics of coupled natural and human systems (CNHS).</description>
