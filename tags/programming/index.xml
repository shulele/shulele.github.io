      <description>Objective The objective to this class is to learn the steps involved in developing mathematical models for applied environmental/water resources problems, and using numerical methods to solve these mathematical models.
To become familiar with:
 explicit method, implicit method, Linear/Non-Linear Partial Differential Equations (PDE), and numeric solutions for advection-dispersion equations.  To write or use existing finite element and/or boundary element programs to analyze project scale problems.â€¨Prerequisite for attendee  College calculus and algebra Groundwater hydraulics Basic programming knowledge, such as C/C++, Java, R, python, Matlab, etc.</description>
