      <description>I love to train the next generation of hydrologists and environmental scientists. Just as the invention of computer to realize the ideas in sciences, the numeric modeling also provides flexible and assessable perspective on the watershed and the nature-human relationship. It is my belief that every student is capable of tasting the passion that I feel for hydrologic modeling by becoming practitioner in the exploration of hydrological theories, researches and models.</description>
