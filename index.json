The secondary objective of this proposal is to leverage this assessment capability to improve our ability to predict these outcomes, by identifying the process-level drivers of outcome biases and evaluating the most appropriate and efficient ways to couple climate models, hydrologic models, and models of human impacts. Tasks in hydrologic modeling  Develop a hydrologic modeling system for both the Sacramento watershed and several subcatchments. Calculate key hydrological metrics, including stream flow, groundwater table, soil moisture, and snow pack.\u000b Evaluate the quality of the hydrologic model and identify potential issues related to its performance.\u000b Develop a statistical downscaling technique using both traditional statistical and machine learning methods that digests input to the hydrologic model and mimics the output of the model.\u000b Determine which input variables are most relevant for producing an accurate statistical model.     Spatial Data Annual Precipitation          Sacramento Watershed The Sacramento River flows from Southern Oregon and to San Francisco Bay. Total drainage area is ~72000 km2. Elevation ranges from 0 to 4200m. The climate in SW is semi-arid hot Mediterranean. The spatial climatic characteristics are not only affected by latitude, terrain and snow coverage, but also by wind and ocean currents. Dramatic seasonal and annual climatic variations exist as well as large spatial heterogeneity. The mountains on the eastern and northern edges of the domain accumulate rain and snow which funnels into the groundwater of the whole watershed. Annual precipitation ranges from 400 mm/year to 1500 mm/year, however extreme annual precipitation was more than 4000 mm/year in Northern mountainous area in 1983, and mean precipitation was only 270 mm/year from the 2013 extreme drought year.\nAnimation of spatial annual precipitation in Sacramento Watershed     Monthly variation of precipitation in Sacramento Watershed Annual precipitation variation from 1979 to 2017 based on NLDAS data          Simulation and Results The calibration of the PIHM model used the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) (Hansen 2006,Auger 2005). The automatic CMA-ES calibration is robust and able to converge to global optimization with low computing cost.\nRiver discharge The stream flow in the watershed follows the seasonal variation of precipitation. During drought years, the base flow from groundwater depletion contributes to the streamflow, and the excess infiltration replenishes ground water in wet seasons. For small watersheds in the Central Valley, such as catchment #9 where precipitation is less and the aquifer is thicker, the contribution from groundwater is small. Calibration based on discharge of four subcatchments \nGround water variation The ground water near the river channel is shallower than the hill-slope. The spatial distribution pattern of ground water is controlled by topography, soil/geology characteristics and shape of the watershed. Steep slopes store less ground water than moderate slopes, because a steep hydraulic gradient on steep slopes drive the lateral groundwater flow.\n             Ground water spatial distribution Temporal fluctuation from 2000 to 2017.    Ground water seasonal fluctuation follows the climatic variation. However, the seasonal variations in some catchments are relatively larger than others. The inter-annual variation in #5 sub-catchment is larger than seasonal variation. Although the annual precipitation trends in each sub-catchments are comparable, the trend in multiple-year changes of ground water table varies. This requires further analysis on water balance and the memory effect of ground water storage.\n","date":1550974394,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1550974394,"objectID":"dffa2623aa5daf1ae27a612fd10d39e2","permalink":"/research/hyperion/","publishdate":"2019-02-23T21:13:14-05:00","relpermalink":"/research/hyperion/","section":"research","summary":"Introduction of HYPERION  The objective of HYPERION is the development of a comprehensive regional hydroclimate data assessment capability focused on feature-specific metrics and stakeholder-relevant outcomes.

It is my belief that every student is capable of tasting the passion that I feel for hydrologic modeling by becoming a practitioner in the exploration of hydrological theories, researches and models. I had three undergraduate sessions of teaching on Geography Information System years ago. My teaching philosophy rests on three tenets: simplifying the complexity with mathematics, realizing ideas with programming, and integrating students in research.\nSimplifying the complexity with mathematics. I invite my students to practice a series of steps: describing a natural problem, using physical law, making assumptions, making mathematical statement of the laws and solving math equations finally. As the fundamental procedure to think and solve the complex scientific problems, I will ask my students to practice and master this skill.\nRealizing ideas with programming. We all have more ideas than solutions. Programming is one of the best options to realize or visualize your ideas about modeling, improvement and demonstration. I teach students the steps and tips in computing algorithm as well as basic data structure, management, analysis and visualization in various programming language. For example, most of beginners are opt to use GUI tools to process and analysis spatial data processing and analysis, such as ArcGIS and QGIS. Actually, doing such tasks in programming, e.g. Matlab, R or Python, are so efficient that does not further understanding of theory and data only, but also inspires new ideas. After my class, the programming will be student’s first option to do complex computing or data processing.\nIntegrating students in research. Learning from practices is always better than listening in classroom, so I design the scientific problems in researches as on-class examples, solvable homework and projects for students. Due to compatibility of modeling methods, the problems from other fields are very welcomed in my class. For example, in Numeric Methods in Geosciences, one of class I plan to teach, the numeric methods can be used for various fields and topics, such as hydrology, mechanics, geology, limnology, etc., so students must think and practice the scientific problems in their own researches that fits the numeric methods discussed in class. In the final projects, students must pick a best-fit numeric method to solve doable problems in their fields. Of course, I will help them to define and solve the problems with tenet one and two mentioned above.\nI find teaching students fulfilling because it offers an opportunity for me to engage and collaborate with the next generation of scholars and leaders. Besides, I also learn from my students. I offer a range of classes, from technical courses on hydrologic modeling, spatial data processing, data mining to seminars on urbanization and climate change.\n","date":1548979200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548979200,"objectID":"114f070fb90abb9707b81669e7c852fd","permalink":"/app/teachingstatement/","publishdate":"2019-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/app/teachingstatement/","section":"app","summary":"I love to train the next generation of hydrologists and environmental scientists.

The leading project is CNH-L: Linking land-use decision making, water quality, and lake associations to understand human-natural feedbacks in lake catchments, cooperated with multiple universities and institutes(e.g. Virginia Tech, Pennsylvania State University, University of Wisconsin, Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies, Michigan State University ).\nIntroduction of project  Freshwater lakes and their catchments present a rich and fascinating opportunity to examine the dynamics of coupled natural and human systems (CNHS). Humans derive great benefit from the irreplaceable services provided by lakes, such as drinking water, recreation, and fisheries, while at the same time contributing to the degradation of the very waters upon which they depend. However, degradation in the water quality attributes that people value can serve as a catalyst for behavioral change through collective action, as evidenced by the increasing momentum of citizen-driven lake associations. To identify and quantify these feedbacks between lake water quality and human behavior, we propose to develop a novel, coupled modeling framework that captures how land-use decision making interacts with hydrological and limnological processes to transform nutrient loads into changes in lake water quality, and how altered water quality feeds back to human systems by affecting the amenities that people value. Our model will extend our interdisciplinary focus by examining how lake associations respond to changes in lake water quality and how their activities influence the behavior of citizens and policy makers to protect their freshwater resources. To construct the coupled model, we will augment our data and modeling resources with new information on the organizational capacity and effectiveness of three active and established lake associations. Our coupled modeling framework flexibly links key human and natural systems in three focal lake catchments, allowing us to investigate human-natural feedbacks in those catchments and to build on our understanding of those linkages to generate insight into CNHS at a broad scale.\nWater quality and human welfare are driven by the dynamic interactions among and between human and natural systems within lake catchments.

Previous work can be computationally intensive and is mainly based on low-level cues extracted from RGB data and implemented on a PC for a fixed sensor network (such as traditional CCTV). We present a practical and efficient framework for mobile devices (such as smart phones and robots) where high-level semantic soft biometrics are extracted from RGB and depth data. By combining these cues, our approach attempts to provide robustness to noise, illumination, and minor variations in clothing. This mobile approach may be particularly useful for the identification of persons in areas ill-served by fixed sensors or for tasks where the sensor position and direction need to dynamically adapt to a target. Results on the BIWI dataset are preliminary but encouraging. Further evaluation and demonstration of the system will be available on our website.","tags":[],"title":"A Person Re-Identification System For Mobile Devices","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Research"],"content":" This project is the hydrologic modeling part of the project NSF Hydrologic and Water Quality Modeling for Green Infrastructure.
